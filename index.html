            <label for="sixth">How much does Netflix cost?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Yes, Netflix offers a variety of kid-friendly content and features to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for children. Here are some reasons why Netflix can be good for kids:

                    1. Parental Controls
                    
                    Netflix provides extensive parental controls that allow parents to create kids' profiles with age-appropriate content.
                    
                    Parents can also set maturity ratings for each profile, ensuring that children only have access to content suitable for their age group.
                    
                    You can lock adult profiles with a PIN to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content.
                    
                    
                    2. Dedicated Kids' Section
                    
                    Netflix has a dedicated Kids section with a wide selection of shows and movies for children, organized by age group (e.g., 2-4, 5-7, 8-10).
                    
                    The content includes popular cartoons, educational programs, family-friendly movies, and Netflix Originals like Carmen Sandiego, The Magic School Bus Rides Again, and My Little Pony.
                    
                    
                    3. Educational Content
                    
                    Netflix offers many educational shows, including documentaries and series that teach kids about science, nature, history, and more.
                    
                    
                    4. Ad-Free Viewing
                    
                    Netflix is completely ad-free, which is a big plus for parents who don't want their kids exposed to advertisements while watching content.
                    
                    
                    5. Downloadable Content
                    
                    Parents can download kids' shows and movies for offline viewing, which is helpful for trips or situations where internet access is limited.
                    
                    
                    However, parents should always review the content their children are watching and use the provided controls to manage screen time and monitor what their kids are consuming.</p>
